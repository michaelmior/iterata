# iterata
Useful extensions to Scala's Iterator. Think _errata for iterators_.

## Installation

Using SBT:

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "com.timgroup" %% "iterata" % "0.1.6"
```

Or download the jar [directly from maven central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/timgroup/iterata_2.11/).

Iterata is currently published for Scala 2.11 only, please feel free to let us know if you'd like a build for a different Scala version.

## Usage

### 1. Parallel processing iterator: `#par()`

Use the `#par()` method to add parallelism when processing an `Iterator` with functions chained via `#map` and `#flatMap`. It will eagerly evaluate the underlying iterator in chunks, and then evaluate the functions on each chunk via the Scala Parallel Collections. For example:

```scala
scala> import com.timgroup.iterata.ParIterator.Implicits._
scala> val it = (1 to 100000).iterator.par().map(n => (n + 1, Thread.currentThread.getId))
scala> it.map(_._2).toSet.size
res2: Int = 8 // addition was distributed over 8 threads
```

You can provide a specific chunk size, for example `it.par(100)`.

Note that only the following Iterator methods are implemented (so far) to make use of parallel collections:

  * `#map`
  * `#flatMap`
  * `#filter`
  * `#find`

#### Grouped vs Ungrouped

The `#par()` method is available on any iterator, and takes an optional chunk size parameter. However, if you already have a `GroupedIterator`, you can simply call `#par` since it is already grouped. For example:

```scala
scala> val it = (1 to 100000).iterator.grouped(4).par
```

### 2. Memoize exhaustion iterator: `#memoizeExhaustion`

Use the `#memoizeExhaustion` method to wrap an `Iterator` so that its `#hasNext` method will
not be called again after returning `false`. This is useful in cases where it is expensive
to check if there is a next element, such as when I/O is involved.

Can serve as a workaround for [SI-9623](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9623), where
after concatenating two iterators with `++`, the left iterator's `#hasNext` will be called twice
for every call to the right iterator's `#next()`.

```scala
scala> import com.timgroup.iterata.MemoizeExhaustionIterator.Implicits._
scala> val it1 = new IteratorWithExpensiveHasNext()
scala> val it2 = new IteratorWithExpensiveHasNext()
scala> (it1.memoizeExhaustion ++ it2).foreach(_ => ())
scala> it1.numTimesHasNextReturnedFalse
res2: Int = 1
```
